# FileSearcher
Small c# executable file that can search between different text files. You can open .py and .jar files without an IDE and search for words inside them.  

Feel free to edit it and improve it.


For the moment it is just a simple console that pops up. No administrator perms needed.


If you feel uncomfortable with the .exe file, just copy and paste the code in Program.cs to an existing IDE and run it.



Take in mind that encrypted files won't work quite right.
