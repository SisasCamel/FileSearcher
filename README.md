# FileSearcher
Small C# code that can search between different text files. You can open .py and .java files without an IDE and search for words inside them.  

Feel free to edit this code and improve it.

<You can turn this code into an executable file with visual studio>

For the moment it is just a simple console that pops up. No administrator perms needed.


If you feel uncomfortable with the .exe file, just copy and paste the code in Program.cs to an existing IDE and run it.



Take in mind that encrypted files won't work quite right nor will do pdf files, images or other executable files.
